# Shrek-DFT
I did a discrete Fourier transform on Shrek. Now I can draw him with rotating circles!

A [Coding Train Challenge](https://youtu.be/MY4luNgGfms) was to make Discrete Fourier Transforms on images. I made a few modifications on the code and added a data sorting algorithm that converts the (x,y) data output of a drawing site into a JSON file that is usable for the DFT.
