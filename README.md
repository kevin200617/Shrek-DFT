# Shrek-DFT
I did a discrete Fourier transform on Shrek. Now I can draw him with rotating circles!

A Coding Train Challenge was to make Discrete Fourier Transforms on images. I made a few modifications on the code and added a data sorting algortimths that converts the (x,y) data of a mouse cordinate into a JSON file that is usable for the program.
